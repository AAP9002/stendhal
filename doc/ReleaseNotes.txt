Stendhal 1.48: Aesthetically Pleasing
-------------------------------------

The world of Faiumoni has just gotten a little fancier. You may notice that the clouds have cleared
in Kikareukin, revealing a beautiful view of Semos below.


Technical Notes
---------------

Users that adjusted volume levels in the Android/web client in the previous release will initially
experience low volume. Simply re-adjust to desired levels. The issue was related to how volume
levels are configured and stored. The Stendhal server uses an integer value in the range 0-100 to
defne volume, while HTMLAudioElement used in the web client uses a floating point value in the range
0.0-1.0. It was intented for the web client to match the server and convert to/from float values
when adjusting volume. However, an oversight led to float values being stored in the configration
instead of integer.
